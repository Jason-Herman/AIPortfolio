Description: Implement k-means clustering to segment a color image.
Build a Gaussian mixture model to be trained with expectation-maximization.
Experiment with varying the details of the Gaussian mixture modelâ€™s implementation.
Implement and test a new metric called the Bayesian information criterion, which guarantees a more robust image segmentation.

To Run: All functions and descriptions are found in mixture_models.ipynb for convenience.
